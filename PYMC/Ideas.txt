for the sake of getting started, a 2d proof of concept will be made

Tiles:
 color
 hue variance
 saturation variance
 value variance
 mass
 conversions (water flowing into dirt = mud)
 integrety*
 //when block is placed it calculates and stores structural integrety value based on highest value surrounding it
 //* = per instance
Chunk:
 8x8x8
 8 x stick values
 8 y stick values
 8 z stick values
Generate:
 custom script to make level
 default:
  get perlin noise
  make values that are empty and under water level water
  use 3d perlin noise to make caves and 3d terrain
  scatter water throughout caves
  scatter trees around surface
  calculate integrety for each tile
  set every tile as active
  run physics pass untill stable or 1000 passes
Tick:
 for each active point:
  check for updates
  update tile:
   add a bit of momentum to tile
   do update
   mark surrounding as moving
